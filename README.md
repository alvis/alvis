    You don't have to be the bad guy.
    You are the most talented, most interesting, and most extraordinary person in the universe.
    And you are capable of amazing things. Because you are the Special.

<h1 align="center">Hi <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="28">, I'm Alvis</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm a curious techy turned maths PhD turned entrepreneur from London.</h3>

I pioneered the first 3D engraved phone cases 10 years ago you  probably have seen similar product on the street. I am also an ex payment tech leader, leading a fantastic team that makes payment in foreign counties like a local.

I spend a lot of time making sure my life is meaningful. There are lots of things I can do but I believe impact can only be delivered if I choose a different path than others. I love to try new things. I am not afraid of do things that many do. I want to spend the rest of my years pushing the boundaries of what is possible and hopefully some of my contribution can help make our world a better place.

Today, I'm creating [**co.e.o**](https://coeo.is), a career focused community for individuals and teams who are different - they are not the "average" and have difficulty finding other specials to exchange ideas or work together on something that create values!
